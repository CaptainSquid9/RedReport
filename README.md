# **Redreport**
### *Believing in your own story carries no shame*


The prototype website anonymously collects a general classification of the discomfort and the location where it happens. It requires no justification or explanation from victims while not accusing any individual of anything. Instead, it validates the problem's existence and focuses on helping the victim feel supported as quickly as possible. 

It displays the data visually to show the reality of the problem for students and administrators currently on campus. Additionally, it has room to highlight progress made as my team works with administrators in those locations to address the issue appropriately. The project complements the available reporting tools but aims to recognize the existence of cases that would usually go unreported.
